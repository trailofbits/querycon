      This talk introduces security event monitoring on Linux, and our lessons

      based on eBPF. We discovered what works, what {`doesn’t`}, and some paths

      Osquery is a powerful and intuitive tool, but everything is not always as 
      it seems. In this talk we will demonstrate 10 gotchas that can lead to 
      unexpected results, and explain how to avoid them. If you have used osquery, 
      you have likely stumbled upon some of these. If not yet, you will.

      This talk will dive into 10 common issues that new (and experienced) osquery 
      users run into. In the format of interactive demos, we will explore these 
      problems and the technical explanations underlying them. All osquery users 
      will benefit from a greater understanding of how to work with the osquery 
      internals to retrieve accurate, timely results.

      <p>
      User-Focused Security is an IT/Security methodology that is being rapidly 
      adopted by {`today's`} fastest growing companies and technical teams. The 
      term, coined by Netflix in 2017, describes a program that discourages 
      locking-down devices in favor of transparently communicating your 
      security policy to your users and giving them the tools to ensure they 
      are compliant.

      With a little bit of ingenuity and time, Osquery is the perfect tool to 
      build your own User-Focused Security program. In this talk, Jason Meller 
      will discuss both the technical and human lessons Kolide learned building 
      User-Focused experience on top of Osquery and Slack. After this talk, 
      you should have all the information you need to build and test-pilot your 
      own User-Focused security program and empower your users to take a more 
      active role in the security of their organization.

      An often overlooked but necessary part of a production Osquery deployment 
      is generating platform native packages and installers. This process can 
      be incredibly challenging, as each operating system has its own idioms 
      and tooling for creating installers, different systems for maintaining 
      persistence through restarts, and distinct processes for code signing.

      To make this easier for our customers, Kolide created The Kolide Launcher 
      as an open source project aimed at removing the hurdles of installing, 
      updating, and using Osquery at scale. 

      In this talk, Joseph will describe Kolide {`Launcher’s`} build process, 
      its approach to multi-format packaging, how to build and debug a Windows

    >
      <p>
        Osquery comes with a powerful SQL abstractions layer to query hosts for
        various information that can be leveraged e.g. for network security. In
        standard deployment however, the hosts simply execute a statically
        defined schedule of queries, whose results might be useful for later
        analysis. Logs are forwarded to a central storage and can then be
        processed via arbitrary additional tools. With bro-osquery, we go beyond
        his standard use case with respect to several aspects.
      </p>

      <p>
        The intention of bro-osquery is to collect host and network data by a
        common platform and to provide the ability to correlate them for network
        monitoring and intrusion detection. When monitoring either hosts or the
        network alone, the other one is a blind spot in your monitoring. But
        when monitoring both, information from hosts and network can perfectly
        complement each other. With their correlation, you gain more detailed
        knowledge about the activities of hosts and achieve a better visibility
        on the complete network infrastructure. The principle of correlation is
        to link host information for processes that emit traffic with network
        information for the corresponding packets.
      </p>

      <p>
        In bro-osquery we implement this concept for the host monitor osquery
        and the Bro network IDS. By establishing a bi-directional
        publish-subscribe communication between osquery hosts and Bro, they can
        directly exchange data, i.e., SQL queries and their results. We provide
        a framework of Bro scripts that allows to run custom queries against
        all, individuals, or specific groups of hosts. Bro dynamically controls
        the query schedule of the hosts, retrieves and processes the
        corresponding data, and it can even asynchronously query hosts on demand
        for additional data.

        Not all features are created equally. Most features improve

        the baseline product becomes something entirely new. We call these
        features Super Features.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk, we’ll review a user feature wishlist gathered from
        interviews with 5 Silicon Valley tech teams who use osquery. From these,
        we’ll identify the Super Features - features that, if built, would
        fundamentally change the value proposition of osquery for the better.
        We’ll explain how these developments could transform osquery’s power in
        technical organizations.

      title="Security Engineer"
    >
      <p>
        Out of the box, osquery comes with many tables covering a wide array of
        information. When getting started, you might write queries against these
        tables to reveal specific information about services, files,
        applications, or similar that can be parsed with a tool like Zentral or
        Streamalert. However, these indvidual results might not paint the whole
        picture about the state of your fleet, especially if there are multiple
        conditions which need to be met and checked.
      </p>

      <p>
        By deeply diving into the power of SQL syntax we can make use of
        multiple tables and queries at the same time to find answers to complex
        questions, such as identifying software misconfigurations which lead to
        security vulnerabilties. Instead of relying solely on basic results and
        having to piece together data on the backend, we can use osquery to
        directly find complex state of processes, files, and other system states
        which are in need of remediation. The SQL interface for osquery is a
        unique one, but we will use it to find information which no other tool
        could give us in a simple way, and we will do it in just one (long)
        line.

        Learn about core functions and architecture of Zentral. Zentral is a
        open source hub to process event streams from osquery and other sources
        into the ElasticStack. Besides support for distinct osquery features
        like file carving, Zentral provides numerous integrations for inventory
        acquisition and alerting.

        Imagine this: You discover osquery and find love at first sight. You
        have experience writing native systems code and ideas about new queries
        and want to do the right thing. A documented journey of an outside dev
        attempt to find his way in the community and make a meaningful
        contribution.

        The {"age of the API"}, security orchestration, big data & ML have all
        come and gone, but SOCs are still outmanned and outgunned. There is now
        an ability to integrate systems, store large amounts of data and
        leverage algorithms to do what a SOC analyst does with machine speed,
        but how does a company leverage this data and these capabilities? Come
        see a history of these technologies applied to security and lessons
        learned on how to apply them.

        Facebook created osquery with certain guiding principles: {`don't`} pry into
        {`user's`} data, {`don't`} change the state of the system, {`don't`} create network
        traffic to third parties. For those that {`didn't`} want to play by these
        rules, they created the extension interface. {`We've`} begun experimenting
        with what is possible with extensions that would not be with mainline
        osquery: integrating with third-party services, writable tables,
        host-based firewall administration, malware vaccination, and more. We
        will share some of our lessons-learned on the challenges of using
        osquery — originally intended as a read-only information gatherer — as a
        control interface.

      <p>
        This talk is designed for osquery developers and will be deep-dive into
        osquery internals. The osquery eventing tables, and the internal pubsub
        framework, make it possible to have osquery record data when it happens,
        not just when you query. We will go over what data already exists,
        queries that can be built on these for instant new detections, and how
        the framework is implemented so you can build exactly what you need.
