      osql is a community-oriented fork of osquery. Its goals are making 
      the development process more open and predictable, reviewing and 
      accepting community contributions more quickly, and restoring the
      {` community’s`} confidence and direct participation in the osquery project. 
      In this talk, we discuss how we intend to maintain a successful community 
      fork of a major open-source project.

      <p>
      This talk introduces security event monitoring on Linux, and our lessons 
      learned from attempts to implement it within osquery. Our first experience 
      with osquery event monitoring was rewriting its use of Auditd. In order to 
      capture events within containers, we next implemented an event publisher 
      based on eBPF. We discovered what works, what {`doesn’t`}, and some paths 
      forward.

      Osquery is a powerful and intuitive tool, but everything is not always as 
      it seems. In this talk we will demonstrate 10 gotchas that can lead to 
      unexpected results, and explain how to avoid them. If you have used osquery, 
      you have likely stumbled upon some of these. If not yet, you will.

      This talk will dive into 10 common issues that new (and experienced) osquery 
      users run into. In the format of interactive demos, we will explore these 
      problems and the technical explanations underlying them. All osquery users 
      will benefit from a greater understanding of how to work with the osquery 
      internals to retrieve accurate, timely results.

    >
      <p>
      User-Focused Security is an IT/Security methodology that is being rapidly 
      adopted by {`today's`} fastest growing companies and technical teams. The 
      term, coined by Netflix in 2017, describes a program that discourages 
      locking-down devices in favor of transparently communicating your 
      security policy to your users and giving them the tools to ensure they 
      are compliant.

      With a little bit of ingenuity and time, Osquery is the perfect tool to 
      build your own User-Focused Security program. In this talk, Jason Meller 
      will discuss both the technical and human lessons Kolide learned building 
      User-Focused experience on top of Osquery and Slack. After this talk, 
      you should have all the information you need to build and test-pilot your 
      own User-Focused security program and empower your users to take a more 
      active role in the security of their organization.

      For those of us on Macs, Spotlight is a critical operating system feature 
      we rely on daily to find the files we need littered throughout our hard 
      drives. Despite its usefulness in our daily lives, very few security 
      products take advantage of this incredible index of information to find 
      security risks across our device fleet. In this talk, Fritz Ifert-Miller 
      will walk you through {`Osquery's`} mdfind virtual table, teach you 
      {` Spotlight's`} advanced search syntax, and surprise you with the breadth
      and depth of information you can uncover. The talk will cover practical 
      use-cases and features Kolide has built on top of this table to help our 
      users discover and eliminate potential sources of data breaches.

      <p>
      An often overlooked but necessary part of a production Osquery deployment 
      is generating platform native packages and installers. This process can 
      be incredibly challenging, as each operating system has its own idioms 
      and tooling for creating installers, different systems for maintaining 
      persistence through restarts, and distinct processes for code signing.

      To make this easier for our customers, Kolide created The Kolide Launcher 
      as an open source project aimed at removing the hurdles of installing, 
      updating, and using Osquery at scale. 

      In this talk, Joseph will describe Kolide {`Launcher’s`} build process, 
      its approach to multi-format packaging, how to build and debug a Windows 
      service, and several lessons learned after one hundred thousand builds.

      From Carbon Black to Trail of Bits to Kolide, there are now a variety of

      security teams in corporate environments. {`We’ll`} take a look at the 
      trends {`we’ve`} come across in the last 18 months that could remove 
      some commons barriers of Osquery management, and lead a discussion around 
      what else can be done to get more people using and contributing back to 
      this project.

      Teams often lean on standardized third-party security frameworks as the

      process for identifying and grouping specific osquery tables to fill in 
      the gaps within the frameworks your organization subscribes to, whether 
      {` that’s`} NIST, MITRE {`ATT&CK`}, or industry-based regulations.

      Osquery has a mechanism for extending its core via extensions, but it {`doesn’t `}
      allow an extension to participate in {`osquery's`} event framework. In this talk, 
      we will describe how we overcame some of the design constraints in the osquery 
      extension model, in order to create event-driven tables in an extension. As 
      well, we will share our wishlist for how the extension ecosystem for osquery 
      could be improved to enable some exciting potential use-cases for the 
      endpoint agent.

      <p>
      Modern infrastructure and deployment methods, as well as web-scale infrastructure 
      have brought about a new paradigm in infrastructure management. Short lived and 
      ephemeral resources allow applications to scale up and down on demand.

      Unfortunately this means that one of the primary information gather methods of 
      osquery, scheduled queries, becomes far less useful if queries are scheduled for 
      a longer interval than the infrastructure will exist.

      This {`doesn’t`} mean osquery and scheduled queries are no longer useful, far 
      from it. It simply means that we need to adjust our way of thinking a bit and 
      adapt our methods of information gathering to overcome these new issues.

      Stories, use cases and lessons learnt from the front line: Hugh will 
      demonstrate how powerful osquery is across compliance,

      complete picture of your IT estate and security posture. This talk is 
      aimed at IT and Security operations.

      Zercurity has been using osquery in production workloads from startups 
      to listed companies. They use osquery for inventory management, monitoring, 
      compliance, risk, vulnerability management and IAM to name a few. Hugh will
      share some of their takeaways over the last few years and tell you 
      about some of the things you can build atop osquery.
