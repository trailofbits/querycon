            User-Focused Security is an IT/Security methodology that is being rapidly
            adopted by {`today's`} fastest growing companies and technical teams. The
            term, coined by Netflix in 2017, describes a program that discourages
            locking-down devices in favor of transparently communicating your
            security policy to your users and giving them the tools to ensure they
            are compliant.

            With a little bit of ingenuity and time, Osquery is the perfect tool to
            build your own User-Focused Security program. In this talk, Jason Meller
            will discuss both the technical and human lessons Kolide learned building
            User-Focused experience on top of Osquery and Slack. After this talk,
            you should have all the information you need to build and test-pilot your
            own User-Focused security program and empower your users to take a more
            active role in the security of their organization.

            Osquery is a powerful and intuitive tool, but everything is not always as
            it seems. In this talk we will demonstrate 10 gotchas that can lead to
            unexpected results, and explain how to avoid them. If you have used osquery,
            you have likely stumbled upon some of these. If not yet, you will.

            This talk will dive into 10 common issues that new (and experienced) osquery
            users run into. In the format of interactive demos, we will explore these
            problems and the technical explanations underlying them. All osquery users
            will benefit from a greater understanding of how to work with the osquery
            internals to retrieve accurate, timely results.

            Osquery has a mechanism for extending its core via extensions, but it {`doesn’t `}
            allow an extension to participate in {`osquery's`} event framework. In this talk,
            we will describe how we overcame some of the design constraints in the osquery
            extension model, in order to create event-driven tables in an extension. As
            well, we will share our wishlist for how the extension ecosystem for osquery
            could be improved to enable some exciting potential use-cases for the
            endpoint agent.

          <p>
            Modern infrastructure and deployment methods, as well as web-scale infrastructure
            have brought about a new paradigm in infrastructure management. Short lived and
            ephemeral resources allow applications to scale up and down on demand.

            Unfortunately this means that one of the primary information gather methods of
            osquery, scheduled queries, becomes far less useful if queries are scheduled for
            a longer interval than the infrastructure will exist.

            This {`doesn’t`} mean osquery and scheduled queries are no longer useful, far
            from it. It simply means that we need to adjust our way of thinking a bit and
            adapt our methods of information gathering to overcome these new issues.

            how the table generate() function is called? In this talk, listeners will gain
            insight into the sqlite3 virtual table API.

            aimed at IT and Security operations.

            Zercurity has been using osquery in production workloads from startups
            to listed companies. They use osquery for inventory management, monitoring,
            compliance, risk, vulnerability management and IAM to name a few. Hugh will

            This talk introduces security event monitoring on Linux, and our lessons
            learned from attempts to implement it within osquery. Our first experience
            with osquery event monitoring was rewriting its use of Auditd. In order to
            capture events within containers, we next implemented an event publisher
            based on eBPF. We discovered what works, what {`doesn’t`}, and some paths
            forward.

            An often overlooked but necessary part of a production Osquery deployment
            is generating platform native packages and installers. This process can
            be incredibly challenging, as each operating system has its own idioms
            and tooling for creating installers, different systems for maintaining
            persistence through restarts, and distinct processes for code signing.

            To make this easier for our customers, Kolide created The Kolide Launcher
            as an open source project aimed at removing the hurdles of installing,
            updating, and using Osquery at scale.

            In this talk, Joseph will describe Kolide {`Launcher’s`} build process,
            its approach to multi-format packaging, how to build and debug a Windows
            service, and several lessons learned after one hundred thousand builds.
